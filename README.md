# PERT Calculator App

Creating a PERT calculator app in Flutter

## Getting Started

This should just work out of the box. Just connect an IOS simulator, Android emulator, or just hit the Play/Debug button to start up the app locally. 

To get the app on a physical device, that takes more work. (TBD)
